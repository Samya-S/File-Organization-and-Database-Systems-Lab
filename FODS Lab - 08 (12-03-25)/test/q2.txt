Q2: Why following is non-serializable

            19	       27	     44	      62	    67	      69	
Job A	                       Read(Z)	                   Write(Y)	
Job B	            Write(Y)            Read(W)	
Job C	  Write(W)                               Write(Z)	

Solution:  
    Reason: [W(19,62) TS(C)<TS(B)] [Y(27,69) TS(B)<TS(A)] [Z(44,67) TS(A)<TS(C)] CBAC is cycle.
